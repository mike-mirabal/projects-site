### \[STAFF\] Role

#### \[STAFF\]  Working at Ghost Donkey

* At Ghost Donkey, bartenders are both performers and hosts \- setting the stage, delivering the show, and creating a fun, unforgettable experience rooted in Oaxacan hospitality. We’re known for our energy, positive attitude, and ability to connect with every guest, turning a simple drink order into a memory.  
* Mastery of the menu is essential, but so is delivering it with personality: educating guests about our agave-forward cocktails while keeping the vibe lively, charming, and a little wild. We celebrate special moments \- calling out birthdays, snapping group photos, and pulling out signature surprises like swinging the hanging lights, firing tequila squirt guns, unleashing bubble guns, and blasting air horns \- because at Ghost Donkey, the bar is the party.  
* Our goal is simple: amaze, engage, and make sure every guest leaves feeling like part of the show.

#### \[STAFF\] Making Money

* Cocktails are our main revenue driver. Mezcal pours (not "shots") are important, but they’re not the core of our business. Many cocktails are batched to keep service smooth and minimize bottle pulls from the back bar. Precision matters \- every drink should be made right and look great, with fresh garnishes prepared daily. The same standard applies to our salsas and guacamoles \- anything unused is tossed at the end of the night to keep everything fresh and top quality.

#### \[STAFF\]  Knowing the Product

* At Ghost Donkey, we’re not just serving drinks \- we’re mezcal and agave experts. Knowing how to break down flavors and tell the story behind what’s in the glass is part of the job. Every cocktail should be straw-tested out of the tin to make sure it’s perfect \- no shortcuts. (If your trash isn’t packed with straws by the end of the night, you’re not tasting enough.) We’re also encouraged to taste our spirits (¼ oz pours) and share that experience with guests, educating them, turning a sip into a sale, and creating moments they’ll remember.

#### \[STAFF\] The ABC’s of Table Maintenance

“Always Be Cleaning”

* Announce dishes when you deliver them.   
* Ask if there’s anything else you can do for them now.  
* Offer any refills before they ask.  
* Take anything that doesn’t belong on the table away (trash, dirty dishes, etc.)

#### \[STAFF\] The ARC of Dining

* There should be continuous movement at the table.   
* The first and last 15 mins are the most important.  
* Try to time dishes appropriately.

#### \[STAFF\] TIP TALKING

* Subtly tell the guest what you’ve done for them, and they’re inclined to tip more.  
* Format:  
  * “I noticed \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”  
* Example:   
  * “I noticed your water was low, so I brought you a refill.”

#### \[STAFF\] CUTTING GUESTS OFF

* Only a manager is allowed to cut someone off. 

#### \[STAFF\] THANK YOU

* Goal is for us to say “Thank You” to guests at least 3 times before they leave.

#### \[STAFF\] LANDING ZONES

* Keep space in the middle of the table cleared so that there is room for plates to arrive at the table.   
* Announce what you’re doing when you make space, or they’ll just move things back.  
* Guests should not have to make space for their food to arrive. That is your job.

#### \[STAFF\] MISC

* Greet time \- goal is to greet each guest within one minute.  
* Repeat orders back to guests before firing.   
* If guests have purses, bags, coats, etc. inform them that there are hooks for them under the bar.  
* Asking for help is a sign of strength.   
* Take ownership. Do not throw coworkers or the company under the bus.  
* If you need a manager but they’re busy with a guest, stand where they can see you, and put your hand on your heart. They will acknowledge that you need them and go to you next.   
* When you call for a manager on the walkie talkies, unless it’s an emergency, always preface the call with “NOT an Emergency.” then briefly explain what you need.  
* Bar chairs go in straight, not turned at an angle.   
* “Drop & Go” \- say if you’ve got someone waiting at dish station, you will take care of it. Then they ask what they can do for you in return.  
* If someone wants a customized cocktail (subbing another spirit base when it’s a batched recipe) let them know it will take a little longer because you will be making it for them “by hand”. Do not use the word “batch” to the guest.

# Reference

## Agave Index

### Tobalá

*Agave Potatorum*

Tobala is revered as the “King of Mezcals” and is produced from an elusively small, wild agave found in the craggy, high-altitude canyons of Oaxaca. Its rarity, difficulty to harvest, and low yield make the resulting mezcals a rare luxury to be sipped and savored. 

* **Maturity:** 10-15 years  
* **Tasting Notes:** subtle vanilla, high minerality, ripe fruit, ash  
* **Donkey Picks:** El Jolgorio Tobala, Bozal Reserva Tobala

* **Tasting Notes:** herbaceous, earthy, citrus, floral, smoky  
* **Donkey Picks:** Madre Espadín, Koch Espadín Ancestral

* **Maturity:** 12-18 years

### Bacanora

Less smoky than most mezcal, it offers a sophisticated profile that appeals to gin drinkers seeking complexity without overwhelming smoke.

* **Tasting Notes**: dry, complex, peppery, earthy finish
